A compiler program is usually composed of text . It is written in a programming language . 
Program text are translated into suitable instruction sequence which is processed by a compiler .
 This is because a computer can only interprete sequence of a particular instruction ( such as binary codes ) .
 A program that automates the translation of a source program ( program texts ) 
into machine codes is called a compiler . Also a source program may only be intepreted ( executed ) each
 time it is run . However the need for a compiler is to avoid the analysis of the characteristic form of 
program every time the program is run as to optimize computer resources .
